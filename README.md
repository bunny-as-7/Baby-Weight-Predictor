# BabyWeightPredictor
This is a Machine Learning model developed using Tensorflow which is completely updated to get deployed in the Google
Cloud Platform.  It uses GCP features such as BigQuery to fetch the dataset, Cloud DataLab to pre-process the data, 
Cloud Machine Learning (CMLE) to deploy the model. 
A Flask web application can be deployed into the GCP platform which can then form a bridge  between the end user and 
the ML model.
